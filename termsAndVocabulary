Agriculture: 
The science and practice of farming and large crop cultivation including 
the rearing of animals to provide food and other products. The science of 
agriculture is now a staple of most major colleges and universities. 

Amend/Amendment: 
To add materials such as fertilizer, compost, or other soil components to 
existing land in order to create a more nutrient rich or beneficial environment 
for plant growth. Some of the most popular types of soil amendments are perlite, 
vermiculite, coconut coir, and worm castings.

Compost: 
A humus-like byproduct form organic matter decomposing that is rich in nutrients, 
typically improved by adding red worms for composting to aid in decomposition. 
Compost is extremely valuable in gardens because it not only adds nutrients, 
it improves the structure of your soil. By incorporating more organic matter, 
that moist and fluffy dark matter to your soil, you allow for better moisture 
retention and water drainage as pore space is increased. Without adequate pore 
space your water doesn't seep deep into the soil allowing for strong root growth. 
You can even run into problems with root rot because there is too much water sitting 
in the root region. You also want to have moist soil so your plants don't dry out. 
Compost also encourages healthy microbial activity suppressing soil borne diseases. 
A healthy soil is the basis for all organic growing endeavors as you create the most 
desirable conditions for your plants.
