Seed Varieties and common properties to consider
###################################################

- Seed types and properties are important to educate yourself on depending
on your goals with growing and gardening , here are some of the basic seed
property definitions.

1) Hybrid Pollination vs. open pollination based seeds
2) GMO vs organic vs hybrid vs heirloom seeds

- Hybrid Pollinated Seed:
    A hybrid seed is produced by a cross pollinated plant.  Hybrid seeds 
    are specifically bred for improved characteristics, such as higher yield, 
    disease resistance, flavor, or color.
    To achieve this, a seed grower will deliberately take pollen from a selected 
    plant and use it to fertilize another selected plant.  The idea is to produce 
    seeds that have characteristics of both parent plants.
    To get a better sense of this, think back to high school biology.  
    Gregor Mendel noticed that if he crossed two tall pea plants, their offspring 
    (seeds) were more likely to grow to be tall as well.  In the modern day, seed 
    companies can do the same thing to create seeds with the desired characteristics.
    When we talk about hybrid seeds, we may often hear “F1 hybrid” or “F2 hybrid”.  
    The number after the “F” simply refers to the generation.  So “F1” refers to a 
    first generation seed.  “F2” refers to a seed harvested from an F1 plant 
    (which was grown from an F1 seed).
    Remember that with hybrid seeds, you may not be able to grow the same plant again 
    from F2 seeds.  For instance, let’s say you plant an F1 hybrid seed, which 
    successfully grows into a plant.
    
- Open Pollinated Seed: 
    Open pollination means that plants are pollinated by bees
    moths, birds, bats, wind, or rain (the plants are “open-pollinated”).
    With open pollination, you are allowing plants to breed randomly, with 
    nature taking its course.  Bees or other pollinators visit the flowers 
    of plants and fertilize with whatever pollen they are carrying around.
    
- GMO Genetically Modified Organism Seed:
    GMO stands for “genetically modified organism”.  
    According to Wikipedia, “a GMO is any organism whose genetic material has 
    been altered using genetic engineering techniques.”

    A GMO seed is a seed that comes from a GMO plant 
    (one whose genetic material has been altered).  
    GMO plants are created in a laboratory for characteristics such as:
    
    Increased yield or productivity
    Improved flavor
    Longer shelf life
    Heat or drought resistance
    Cold resistance
    Disease resistance
    Pest resistance
    Herbicide or pesticide resistance
    
    These traits sound like a good thing for most plants, and it is 
    true that these crops can help to avoid famine and feed more people 
    than we could otherwise.  However, there is some controversy surrounding 
    the question of whether food grown from GMO seeds is safe for human consumption.

    For the most part, GMO seeds are used in large-scale, commercial operations 
    for major crops such as corn and soybeans. 

- Organic Seeds:
    “Organic” refers to the way that seeds (and the plants that they come from) are raised.
    In order to be certified as organic by the USDA, seeds must be raised according to the 
    USDA’s National Organic Program (NOP) standards.
    
    The USDA NOP Standard handbook --> https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/organic/handbook
    
    The NOP is a public-private partnership, and provides accreditation 
    and training to private companies.  These companies then inspect farms 
    and businesses to ensure that they satisfy the standards for organic certification.
    
    According to seedsavers.org, the NOP guidelines say that organic seed growers 
    must plant organic seeds, unless there are none commercially available.  
    Also, these organic seeds are not exposed to prohibited chemicals 
    (such as certain fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides) during growth, harvesting, or processing.
    
    Organic seeds are never GMO, and they can come from either hybrid or open-pollinated plants.  
    Since they can be hybrid, they may not “breed true” if you save the seeds and plant 
    them the next year (that is, you won’t get the same variety of plant in the second 
    year that you got in the first year).
    
- Heirloom Seeds:
    Heirloom seeds are seeds that come from an heirloom plant.  
    According to Wikipedia, “An heirloom plant is an old cultivar of 
    a plant used for food that is grown and maintained by gardeners and farmers.”
    In practice, this means that a family of farmers or gardeners collects and 
    passes down seeds through generations.  Generally, heirloom seeds come from 
    plant varieties that are at least 50 years old.
    
    Heirloom seeds are always open pollinated.  This means that farmers and 
    gardeners are not specifically choosing certain plants to cross pollinate 
    to breed for certain characteristics.

    Instead, gardeners and farmers choose the seeds of the most desirable plants every year.  
    Any resulting changes in plant characteristics happen naturally over time.
    
    Often, these characteristics include improved flavor, increased resistance to pests or diseases
    , and acclimation to local climate and weather patterns.  Choosing the seeds you want from 
    the plants you want is a modern spin on Darwin’s theory of evolution.
    
    Heirloom seeds are usually not GMO.  However, if an heirloom seed is accidentally open pollinated 
    with a GMO crop, the result could be a GMO seed.  However, this is probably a rare occurrence.

    Heirloom seeds are often organic, but this is not guaranteed.  For instance, a gardener 
    using heirloom seeds could conceivably use chemicals in his garden that would disqualify
    him from USDA organic certification.
    So, there can be overlap between organic and heirloom seeds.  In this case, the seeds would 
    be open pollinated (not hybrid), they would come from a plant variety at least 50 years old, 
    and they would be certified organic by the USDA.
