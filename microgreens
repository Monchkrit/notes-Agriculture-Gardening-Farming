1.1) Argugula
     Arugula is a peppery, distinctive-tasting green that originated in the Mediterranean region. 
     It’s also known as rucola, salad rocket, and Italian cress. Arugula is a member of the 
     Brassica, or Cruciferous, family. This classification includes mostly cruciferous vegetables, 
     such as Brussels sprouts, kale, cauliflower, and broccoli.
     
     Arugula’s popularity has as much to do with its health benefits as its taste. 
     One studyTrusted Source cites arugula as being particularly high in cancer-fighting agents.

    This delicious green is a nutrient-dense food that is high in fiber and phytochemicals. 
    Arugula is low in sugar, calories, carbohydrates, and fat. It’s high in several vital 
    nutrients. These include:
    
        Calcium, which helps the blood to clot normally. It’s also necessary for bone health, tooth health, muscle function, and nerve function.
        Potassium, a mineral and an electrolyte that’s vital for heart and nerve function. It also helps the muscles contract normally. Potassium helps to reduce the negative effects of sodium, and it may be beneficial for people with high blood pressure for this reason.
        Folate, a B vitamin. It helps support the production of DNA and other genetic material. It’s particularly important for women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Folate deficiency in pregnant women may lead to spina bifida, a neural tube defect.
        Vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that helps support the immune system. Also known as ascorbic acid, vitamin C is important for tissue health and the absorption of iron from food.
        Vitamin K, which helps with blood coagulation. If you require a prescription blood thinner, such as warfarin (Coumadin), discuss your vitamin K intake with your doctor prior to changing your eating habits.
        Vitamin A, the umbrella term for a group of fat-soluble retinoids. Vitamin A is a powerful antioxidant, which supports immune function, cell growth, night vision, and overall eye health. It also works to help maintain kidney, lung, and heart function.
